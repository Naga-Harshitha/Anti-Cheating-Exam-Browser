Welcome to our anti-cheating exam webpage!

Our extension is designed to prevent cheating during online exams by implementing the following features:

1. Extension will only work on selected URLs (test page) during a certain time/trigger.
2. The browser will open in full screen mode to prevent any distractions.
3. A pop-up will be shown when someone switches between 2 tabs or applications.
4. More than one tab cannot be opened to prevent access to other resources.
5. Users will not be able to close the tab by the normal close button or shortcut keys. The only way to close the tab is by clicking on the “End Test” button.
6. Initial requirement check will be done when the extension is activated:
   a. Audio will be checked to ensure that the user can hear audio for the exam.
   b. Camera will be checked to ensure that the user can be recorded during the exam.
    c. Internet Stability will be checked to ensure that the user has a stable internet connection during the exam.
7. User-related information will be captured in local storage (e.g. IP, requirements check) for security purposes.

1. Install the extension on your browser
2. Enable the extension for the selected URLs (test page)
3. Click on the extension icon to activate it.
